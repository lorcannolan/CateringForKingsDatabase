# CateringForKingsDatabase

From the case study provided to me which I have included in this repository I was required to complete the following:

- Design and submit an ERD for the conceptual schema of the case study. This ERD should be implemented as tables in the group schema.
- From the group schema, grant appropriate privileges to each role in the system.
- TRANSACTION: 
  - This PL/SQL transaction should accept information from the user, manipulate the data in the database and leave it in a consistent state.
  - It should include decision-making and error checking.
- QUERIES: 
  - Each student should write individual queries that show the following:
  - Selection, Projection, Aggregation with filters on aggregates, Union, Minus, Difference, Inner Join, Outer Join, Semi-join, Anti-join and Correlated sub-query.
  - Each query should be tested to ensure that there is data there to satisfy it and to show that it works â€“ i.e. a query that shows the power of the technique being used (e.g. a left join that would return the same as an inner join will not get full marks). You may create views as required but show your code if you do.
